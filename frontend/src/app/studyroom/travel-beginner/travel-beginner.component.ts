  {text1: `Early in the morning, Emily decided to _______ her bicycle to the nearby park. The air was fresh, and the streets were quiet. As she pedaled along, she noticed a bright yellow _______ passing by. It was full of people looking around the city. After a while, Emily reached the park and locked her bicycle. She planned to meet her friend, Mark, who would _______ the train to get there. While waiting, she watched some kids near the lake, trying to move a small boat in the water.

    Soon, Mark arrived, looking a bit rushed. "I almost missed the train!" he said. "The underground train was so full of people, I thought I wouldn't make it in time."

    They decided to have lunch at a caf√© across the city. Since it was far, they chose to _______ a taxi. The taxi driver, a friendly man named Joe, told them exciting stories as he _______ his taxi through the busy city streets.

    After lunch, Emily and Mark went to the airplane museum. They were both interested in how airplanes work. The best part was an old airplane they could see inside. They even pretended to _______ it.

    In the evening, Emily suggested, "Let's take a helicopter ride! It's a fun way to end our day!"

    Mark agreed, and soon they were up in the sky, looking down at the city. The person flying the helicopter showed them the city from above.

    Finally, as it got dark, they went back to the city center. Emily rode her _______ home, and Mark waited for his _______. They said goodbye, happy about their day.`}
